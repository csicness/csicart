			<strong>Hi and welcome to my site.</strong> My name is Curtis and I like to create things. I have a B.A in Printmaking from Rhode Island College. I have a passion for all things creative. My work is made up of Illustration, Concept-Art, and Web Design.

			My work is very simplistic. While working toward my degree, I focused on woodblock printing. This type of art forced me to think in a minimalistic way.
