			<span>My name is Curtis and I like to create things...</span> 
			<br>
			<br>
			My work is made up of Illustration, Concept-Art, and Web Design. I have a B.A in Printmaking from Rhode Island College.
			<br>
			<br>
			My work is very simplistic. While working toward my degree, I focused on woodblock printing. This type of art forced me to think in a minimalistic way.
